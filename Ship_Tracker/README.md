# This is a project to track the movements of a ship and plot them on a map in Python using the folium and Geocoder Libraries.


## I scraped the ship GPS position data from the myshiptracking.com website, and I looked at the vessel HMM DUBLIN with the IMO: 9863314 and the MMSI:356429000 for testing and educational purposes only.
