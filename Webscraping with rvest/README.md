This is a Project to focus on web scraping HTML pages with the rvest package in Rstudio. 
This is my experience of learning from and following this web scraping course: https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/rvest.md

There are three main parts to this project:
1. Reading the webpages into R with rvest using read_html()
2. Selecting the HTML elements from the webpages using the CSS selectors (elements,tags,id, element.class) 
3. Extracting the data from the HTML elements using the html_text and html_text2 functions
